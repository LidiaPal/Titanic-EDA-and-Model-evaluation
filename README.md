Titanic EDA and model evaluation
I have recently finished an IBM data scientist course on Coursera, this is my first EDA and Model evaluation done outside of the course, by myself
I would really appreciate any feedback on it as I still find some concepts quite intimidating (especially ML!)
Thank you :)
